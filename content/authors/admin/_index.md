Hi! I am Benjamin and I am a a Computer Science Master's student at Georgia Tech and the UTC.
I am passionate about ML, and I am currently seeking a 6-month ML research internship starting around June 2023.

I am currently a research assistant at [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en), where I work on localization for autonomous vehicles under the supervision of [Dr. Philippe Xu](https://www.hds.utc.fr/~xuphilip/dokuwiki/).

Previously, I interned at [Scortex](https://scortex.io), where I trained Deep Convolutional Networks with self-supervision to segment defects on industrial parts. I also [co-authored a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12759) on automatically removing defective parts from a fully unlabeled dataset.
