Hi! I'm Benjamin, glad you found my website! I'm a CS Master's student at Georgia Tech graduating May 2024.
I'm passionate about everything ML and Computer Vision. I'm actively seeking either a full-time or a PhD position after graduation. I'd also be interested in internships for summer 2024. Don't hesitate to reach out :)

From June to December 2023, I was an intern at Bosch Research in Singapore, working on foundation models for Computer Vision, under the supervision of [Dr. Chi Trung Ngo](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/chitrungngo). My paper on using SAM in contrastive learning got accepted at the Self-Supervised Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023.

Previously, I've been fortunate to do research on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) under Prof. Cédric Pradalier at [Georgia Tech Europe](https://europe.gatech.edu/en), and autonomous driving under Prof. Philippe Xu at [University of Technology of Compiègne](https://www.hds.utc.fr/en.html) (accepted at IV 2023).
